//Troubles & concerns

1) Couldn't figure out a proper way to do lightbox; discovered you must use JS but couldln't find a decent tutorial that wasn't a plug in
2) Need to manage time with coding and design - need to have a picture ahead of time, or be more thoughtful on time on the next project
3) Sickness - definitely not what I wanted or anticipated so really disappointed and mad at being sick
4) Writing DRY code


Upgrades
1) would like to make sure the website is accessible, so would be willing to change how it looks and making 
2) Dyanmic - more for user to interact with
